## Hi, I’m Shweta Suman 👋

---

I’m a software engineer with several years of experience across the JavaScript backend and Python ecosystems. I enjoy writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that solve real-world problems at scale.

In my professional work, I’ve built and scaled systems ranging from feed timelines and search to video transcoding pipelines, queue-driven architectures, and microservice infrastructure. I’ve worked extensively with asynchronous systems, log-based queues, and production workloads that demand reliability and performance.

Outside of work, I actively tinker with data structures, problem-solving, and side projects. Recently, I:
- Participated in Advent of Code 2025
- Built and refined my personal website
- Started writing technical blogs
- Worked on a Forest Fire Simulation project

When I’m not engineering, you’ll usually find me trekking or lifting weights.
